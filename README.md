# Name Storm ⚡️

Contains a collection of name generators, and runs them all at once so that we get a variety of different names to choose from.

```sh
npm install
./test/run.sh

### Acknowledgments

This project incorporates the amazing work of the following authors and repositories. I am deeply grateful for their contributions to the open-source community:

- **[Luca Sepe](https://github.com/lucasepe/codename):** This project directly utilizes code from the `codename` library, which is a fantastic resource for name generation.
- **[Anand Varma](https://github.com/anandvarma/namegen):** This project draws directly on implementations from the `namegen` repository.
- **[Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/pkg/namesgenerator):** Code from Docker's `namesgenerator` package has been adapted for this project.
- The **[docker-names](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docker-names)** package from npm to generate random names.
- **[Marcel Stör](https://frightanic.com/computers/docker-default-container-names/):** Your article, ["How does Docker generate default container names?"](https://frightanic.com/computers/docker-default-container-names/), provided a clear explanation of Docker's naming logic.  Thank you for providing a name generator publicly available as a [service](http://frightanic.com/goodies_content/docker-names.php).

I extend my sincere thanks to these authors for sharing their work and insights, which were instrumental in building this project. Please refer to their repositories and article for more information and original implementations.
