- **[Anand Varma](https://github.com/anandvarma/namegen):** This project draws directly on implementations from the `namegen` repository.
- **[Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/pkg/namesgenerator):** Code from Docker's `namesgenerator` package has been adapted for this project.
- **[Marcel St√∂r](https://frightanic.com/computers/docker-default-container-names/):** Your article, ["How does Docker generate default container names?"](https://frightanic.com/computers/docker-default-container-names/), provided a clear explanation of Docker's naming logic.  Thank you for providing a name generator publicly available as a [service](http://frightanic.com/goodies_content/docker-names.php).
