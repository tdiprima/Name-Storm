# How to Run the Name Generator

This project includes several scripts for generating random names using different approaches. Below are the files in the project, their descriptions, origins, and how to run them.

---

## **1. getRandomName.js**

### Description
This JavaScript file defines a function that generates random names by combining an adjective and a surname from pre-defined lists. The generated names can optionally include a suffix or be formatted with underscores.

### Origin
Based on a CodePen project ([link](https://codepen.io/mikedryan/pen/vLrgqr)).

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node getRandomName.js
   ```

   The generated random name will be logged to the console.

## **2. names-generator.js**

### Description
This script also generates random names, but its list of adjectives and surnames is adapted from the [Moby Project's](https://github.com/moby/moby) name generator.

### Origin
Adapted from the Moby Project (GitHub repository).

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the script with Node.js:

   ```bash
   node names-generator.js
   ```

   The output will be a random name in the format `adjective_surname`.

## **3. dockerNamesGenerator.js**

### Description
This script uses the `docker-names` package, available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docker-names), to generate random names.

### Origin
Third-party package: `docker-names`.

### How to Run
1. Install the `docker-names` package if not already installed:

   ```bash
   npm install docker-names
   ```

2. Run the script with Node.js:

   ```bash
   node dockerNamesGenerator.js
   ```

   The script will generate and display a random name using the `docker-names` library.

---

## **4. index.html**

### Description
An interactive webpage that displays random names generated by `getRandomName.js`. Clicking anywhere on the page triggers the generation of a new random name.

### Origin
Based on a CodePen project ([link](https://codepen.io/mikedryan/pen/vLrgqr)).

### How to Run
1. Place this file, along with `style.css` and `getRandomName.js`, in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Interact with the page to generate random names.
